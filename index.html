            <p>As a web developer, I possess specialized knowledge in constructing and sustaining websites and web-based
                applications using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am skilled in creating
                engaging, dynamic, and responsive websites while ensuring their smooth functioning by optimizing their
                performance and safeguarding them against potential security threats. Alongside my web development
                expertise, I am also certified in SEO by eShikon Academy and Google Digital Garage and have completed an
                Email Marketing Course from HubSpot Academy. Currently, I am working as an Academic Writer at Livingston
                Research, where I bring my technical skills and writing abilities together to deliver top-quality work.
